# Javascript-Quiz
a quiz site made using the fundamentals of javascript... to quiz yourself on javascript fundamentals!
site is quite barebones when it comes to customization of the page w/ html and css elements, but all the javascript functions that make up the quiz itself, as well as the saving of the scores to the local storage are functional.
